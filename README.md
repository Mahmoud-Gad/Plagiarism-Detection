# Plagiarism-Detection
*Plagiarism Detection: Udacity - Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree*

## Project Overview

This project explores Machine Learning solutions to the problem of plagiarism. by performing binary classification, we are able ot determine weither a file is plagiarised or not. Furthermore, it showcases how a machine learning model can be deployed to amazon sagemaker cloud service allowing the model to be accessible through web or mobile applications using REST API.

&nbsp;

There are 7 files associated with the project:
1. Plagiarism_Feature_Engineering.ipynb
2. Training_a_Model.ipynb
3. helpers.py
4. problem_unittests.py
5. model.py
6. train.py
7. predict.py

files numbered 5, 6 and 7 are found in source_pytorch directory.
